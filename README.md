# Java Style Guide

A style guide - nothing but a set of conventions used to enforce the uniformity of styles. This uniformity facilitates
the understanding of code; especially in large code bases.

This project defines such a style guide for the Javaâ„¢ Programming Language, built on top of
[Google's internal Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).
