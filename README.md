# Extended Google Java Style Guide

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use camelCase for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project serves my
personal standards for source code in the Java&#8482; Programming Language 
based on the official [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide).

This fork <strong>only</strong> holds an extended version of
[Google's Java Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

## Contributing

This style guide is a modified copy of Google's internal style guide.
Changes to the official style guides are made to the internal style guides first and
eventually copied into the versions found at the original repository. **External contributions are
not accepted.** 
Pull requests here are regularly closed without comment too.
Issues that raise questions, justify changes on technical merits,
or point out obvious mistakes may get some engagement and could <strong>in theory</strong> lead to changes.
